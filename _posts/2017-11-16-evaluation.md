This post marks the 10-week milestone of this project. By this point I have completed a single-level demo of the game.

**Deliverables:**

- Working [final game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mimLL4UL4bE)
	- Main menu + one game level
		- Pausing / unpausing
		- Track high scores
	- Game mechanics
		- Choice engine
		- Powerups
		- Scoring system
	- Game design
		- Progression playtested and tuned with multiple people
		- Optimized level layout for AI (multiple iterations of level design)
	- Art + music + sound
		- Composed one track
		- Sound effects for everything
		- Procedural art effects
- Devblog
	- 13 total posts
	- Some CSS ([screenshot](/assets/img/devblog_screenshot_2.png))

**Good things:**

- I've written some decent documentation.
- I managed to get some art and music despite having limited facilities in both.
- It's really fun!

**Bad things:**

- I was in a bit of a rush and could have written better documentation.
- I did not use version control, and thus ran into a few bumps which could have been resolved in seconds with proper version control set up.
- I can't build the game! There's some weird licensing issue which doesn't allow me to actually build an executable.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

- Complete devblog front-end and make website for advertisement
- Created detailed documentation on certain aspects for public reference
- Figure out how to build the game

**Long-Term Next Steps:**

- Make a trailer
- Improve music track
- Add modes
	- More difficulties
	- Multiplayer
- Kickstarter campagin

This post marks the 5-week milestone of this project.

**Deliverables:**

- Initial Unity prototype
	- Algorithm for splatter effect
- Devblog
	- 7 total posts
		- Mini-essay on aesthetic in indie games
		- Concept art
		- Concept music
	- Completed PHP back-end
- Learned Game Maker

**Not a deliverable but also a thing:**

- Game design doc
	- I don't have this written out in any formal spec, but I have a sketchbook somewhere.

**Good things:**

- I've written some pretty comprehensive documentation on my thought processes and learning experiences, even with little actual development on the game.
- My concept art and concept music have given me a direction in which to push the game's mechanics and aesthetic.
- I've learned how ot use Game Maker.

**Bad things:**

- I should have evaluated my workload better from the start of the project.
- I should have given myself more time to learn Game Maker.
- Even though I can now use Game Maker, my progress on the actual final game is behind schedule.

**Goals for next milestone (10 weeks):**

- Completed devblog front-end
- Completed Game Maker demo
	- At least 1 playable level
- Completed art and music
	- At least 1 track
	- Fully programmed procedural aesthetic
	- Animated player character

**Immediate Next Steps:**

- Complete devblog front-end
- Reproduce initial splatter prototype in Game Maker
- Produce and mix test track

Hello all!

Starting from today, this website will host the official development blog of a game that I am working on. The working title is Ablockalypse.

It's going to be a 2D arcade-style platformer where you are forced to juggle decision-making and jumping at the same time. Think [Super Crate Box](http://supercratebox.com/), but with decisions instead of crates.

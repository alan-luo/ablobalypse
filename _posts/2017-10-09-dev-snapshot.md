This is the current state of development as of October 9th, 2017. This is being written in the early stages of development. The final build of the game has not been started yet. I am still in the process of learning the engine. The game currently exists entirely in the design space.

I had a friend help me with a piece of concept music for the game. It's funky and repetitive. It's inspired by the likes of [Super Crate Box](http://www.supercratebox.com/).

It's built on a funky blues-ish progression in Ab (F minor). The bass line goes F-Eb-F-Eb-F-Ab-F-Eb-C. These notes all fall on the F blues scale, giving it the funky blues feel. In addition, every chord is a dominant chord, which drives the piece forward and also adds to the bluesy feel.

I'm planning to add a B section to the 8 measures written so that the track follows an ABA form.

I've completed the Game Maker tutorial series. This means I can start proper prototyping with the new engine soon.

Next steps: add to concept music, produce concept music (move it from paper into sound), start prototyping actual game.
